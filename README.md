# TwitchTimer

Hi there! This is a really quick and dirty timer program I wrote. It writes to a .txt file every second to simulate a countdown. This is especially useful for making a countdown for your stream. In addition, because it writes to a .txt file, a text source that references the countdown.txt file allows you to modify the font of the countdown as well! No more window captures on the boring Google timer. :)

I'm a novice programmer, so the code is gonna look like mom's spaghetti, but please forgive me!

# How to run

It's simple! Click on the .exe, enter in the desired duration of the timer you want, and the program will begin counting down! You won't be able to see it count down in the command prompt, but rest assured, the countdown.txt file that is created is being updated each second.

# To get this to work with OBS:

1) Right click in sources box and click on "Text"
2) Select "Use Text from File"
3) Navigate to the file directory where the .exe and .txt file are stored (they're in the same folder)
4) Select countdown.txt
5) Customize the font to your liking
6) Happy streaming!
